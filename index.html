            <p>
                Metaphor is a Call of Duty Warzone streamer who previously held the world record in solo kills.
                His playstyle can be described as aggressive and reckless, and he does not shy away from a fight.
                <br><br>
                While this playstyle often leads him to lose games, it makes for entertaining gameplay and often high
                kill games.
                As a streamer he prioritizes his chat and does everything he can to interract with his viewers at an
                impressive rate.<br>
